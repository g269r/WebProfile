            <h2>Running from Math, Only to Crash into It – My CSE Journey</h2>
            <p><em>Published on March 25, 2025</em></p>
            <p>Math and I were never destined to be pals. Back in school, I’d sit in class, staring at the blackboard as numbers danced into formulas and equations twisted into knots I couldn’t untangle...</p>
            <p>Every test felt like a showdown I was doomed to lose. I wasn’t just bad at math—I was allergic to it. So, when the time came to chart my future, I saw a glimmer of hope: Computer Science Engineering (CSE)...</p>
            <p>With a grin and a dream, I leapt toward it, convinced I’d left math in the rearview mirror for good. Spoiler alert: I was spectacularly wrong.</p>
            <p>College welcomed me with open arms—and a first-year syllabus that might as well have been titled “Math: The Revenge.”...</p>
            <p>Enter DSA—Data Structures and Algorithms. It started innocently enough. One lazy afternoon, my elder brother, ever the wise mentor, dropped a casual suggestion: “You should start learning DSA...”</p>
            <p>Logic. Complexity analysis. Probability. Combinatorics. Graph theory. It was like math had been hiding in the wings, waiting for its cue to steal the spotlight...</p>
            <p>I won’t pretend I’m a pro now. DSA and I still have our rocky days—heap sort and I are currently in a standoff, and dynamic programming feels like a riddle wrapped in a mystery...</p>
            <p>Maybe I never really outran math. Maybe it was always meant to catch up with me...</p>
