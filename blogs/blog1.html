                    <p>Math and I were never destined to be pals. Back in school, I’d sit in class, staring at the blackboard as numbers danced into formulas and equations twisted into knots I couldn’t untangle. Every test felt like a showdown I was doomed to lose. I wasn’t just bad at math—I was allergic to it. So, when the time came to chart my future, I saw a glimmer of hope: Computer Science Engineering (CSE). A world of sleek code, glowing screens, and endless possibilities—surely, I thought, this was my escape hatch from the clutches of my numerical nemesis. With a grin and a dream, I leapt toward it, convinced I’d left math in the rearview mirror for good.</p>
                    <p><strong>Spoiler alert:</strong> I was spectacularly wrong.</p>
                    <p>College welcomed me with open arms—and a first-year syllabus that might as well have been titled “Math: The Revenge.” Calculus crept in like an uninvited guest, linear algebra loomed over me like a stern professor, and discrete mathematics? That was the final boss I didn’t see coming. Every lecture was a reminder that my grand escape plan had backfired. I’d scribble notes, wrestle with derivations, and pray for passing grades, all while counting down the days until I’d be free. “Second year onwards, math’s gone,” upperclassmen promised with knowing smirks. I clung to that lifeline like a shipwrecked sailor to driftwood, dreaming of a future where coding would be my only master.</p>
                    <p>For a fleeting moment, I thought I’d made it. Second year rolled around, and the timetable confirmed it—no more “Mathematics” glaring back at me. I exhaled, victorious at last. But life, as it turns out, loves a good plot twist.</p>
                    <p>Enter DSA—Data Structures and Algorithms. It started innocently enough. One lazy afternoon, my elder brother, ever the wise mentor, dropped a casual suggestion: “You should start learning DSA. It’s the backbone of coding.” I nodded, intrigued. How hard could it be? I pictured myself mastering sleek lines of code, building apps, and maybe even impressing a recruiter or two. So, I fired up my laptop, cracked my knuckles, and dove into the world of DSA—only to slam headfirst into a wall of math I hadn’t seen coming.</p>
                    <p>Logic. Complexity analysis. Probability. Combinatorics. Graph theory. It was like math had been hiding in the wings, waiting for its cue to steal the spotlight. Big-O notation stared me down, daring me to calculate time efficiencies. Recursion twisted my brain into pretzels, and don’t even get me started on binary trees—they might as well have been algebraic shrubs. I’d escaped the classroom version of math, only to land in a deeper, sneakier version of it. My brother’s “backbone of coding” was starting to feel more like a spine made of equations.</p>
                    <p>At first, I rebelled. “This isn’t what I signed up for!” I’d mutter, slamming my laptop shut after another failed attempt at a sorting algorithm. I wanted to run again—maybe switch to graphic design or poetry, anything that didn’t involve numbers. But something stubborn in me refused to quit. Maybe it was the late-night coffee, or maybe it was the quiet thrill of finally understanding why bubble sort was so inefficient. So, I stayed. I pored over tutorials, scratched out pseudocode on napkins, and begged my smarter friends for explanations.</p>
                    <p>And then, slowly, something shifted. I started to see math not as a bully, but as a guide. It wasn’t just about crunching numbers anymore—it was about solving problems. Algorithms weren’t torture devices; they were puzzles with a purpose. Figuring out how to optimize a search felt like finding a shortcut through a maze. Spotting patterns in data structures was like decoding a secret language. Even probability, once my sworn enemy, turned into a game of “what if?” Math wasn’t the cold, abstract beast I’d feared—it was alive, woven into the fabric of every line of code I wrote.</p>
                    <p>I won’t pretend I’m a pro now. DSA and I still have our rocky days—heap sort and I are currently in a standoff, and dynamic programming feels like a riddle wrapped in a mystery. But I’m not running anymore. Somewhere between debugging a linked list and marveling at a perfectly balanced AVL tree, I stopped seeing math as the enemy. It’s more like a tricky companion—one that keeps me guessing, challenges my patience, and occasionally rewards me with a spark of “Aha!” Logic turns it into a playground, problem-solving makes it a treasure hunt, and every small win feels like a victory lap.</p>
                    <p>Maybe I never really outran math. Maybe it was always meant to catch up with me, slip into my CSE journey, and teach me a lesson I didn’t expect: sometimes, the things we flee from are the ones that shape us most. I’m still on this wild ride, stumbling through algorithms and tripping over edge cases. But now? I’m starting to enjoy the chase—and that, I think, is the real win.</p>
